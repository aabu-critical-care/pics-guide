                    Advances in critical care medicine have significantly
                    reduced mortality rates among critically ill patients. As a
                    result, the number of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors
                    has increased worldwide. Despite improved survival, many
                    patients experience persistent health problems after
                    discharge from the ICU. These long-term complications are
                    collectively known as
                    <b>Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS).</b>
                    PICS represents a major public health concern due to its
                    impact on patients’ functional status, quality of life, and
                    healthcare utilization. <br />
                    Post-ICU recovery is often complex and prolonged. Patients
                    and their families frequently report feeling unprepared for
                    the physical, cognitive, and psychological challenges that
                    emerge after discharge. In low- and middle-income countries,
                    including Jordan, post-ICU follow-up services remain
                    limited, making patient education a critical component of
                    care. Understanding PICS and its management is therefore
                    essential for nurses and other healthcare professionals
                    involved in critical care and post-discharge planning.

                      mental health status that arise after critical illness and
                      persist beyond ICU discharge
                    </b>
                    (Needham et al., 2012). These impairments may continue for
                    months or years and can significantly limit a patient’s
                    ability to return to pre-illness levels of functioning.
                    <br />
                    PICS does not represent a single disease but rather a
                    constellation of interrelated conditions. The syndrome may
                    affect patients, their families, or both. Family members may
                    develop psychological distress, a phenomenon sometimes
                    referred to as <b>PICS-Family (PICS-F). </b> This highlights
                    the broad and multidimensional impact of critical illness
                    beyond the ICU setting.

                    experience at least one component of PICS (Inoue et al.,
                    2019). The prevalence varies depending on patient

                    The pathophysiology of PICS is multifactorial and not fully
                    understood. Physical impairments are primarily related to
                    <b>ICU-acquired weakness</b>, which results from muscle
                    wasting, systemic inflammation, immobility, and critical
                    illness polyneuropathy or myopathy. <br />
                    Cognitive impairments are associated with hypoxia,
                    hypotension, inflammation, metabolic disturbances, and ICU
                    delirium. Neuroinflammation and microvascular injury may
                    contribute to long-term cognitive dysfunction. <br />
                    Psychological impairments arise from the traumatic nature of
                    critical illness, frightening ICU experiences, sleep
                    deprivation, and loss of control. Sedation, mechanical
                    ventilation, and delirium further increase the risk of
                    anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder
                    (PTSD).

                    <b>.1 Physical Impairments </b> <br />
                    Physical symptoms include generalized weakness, fatigue,
                    reduced endurance, impaired balance, and difficulty
                    performing activities of daily living. Many patients
                    experience decreased exercise tolerance and prolonged
                    dependence on caregivers. These impairments significantly
                    affect independence and social reintegration.
                    <br /><b>.2 Cognitive Impairments </b> <br />
                    Cognitive deficits may involve memory impairment, reduced
                    attention span, difficulty concentrating, and impaired
                    executive function. These symptoms can interfere with
                    medication adherence, decision-making, and return to work.
                    Cognitive dysfunction following ICU admission has been
                    compared to mild traumatic brain injury or early dementia in
                    severity. <br /><b>.3 Psychological Impairments </b>
                    <br />Psychological symptoms are common and include anxiety,
                    depression, and PTSD. Patients may experience nightmares,
                    flashbacks, mood changes, irritability, and emotional
                    numbness. These symptoms often coexist with physical and

                    Nurses play a central role in preventing and managing PICS.
                    During ICU admission, nurses contribute to prevention
                    through early mobilization, delirium screening, sedation
                    management, and family engagement. After discharge, nurses
                    are essential in patient education, symptom monitoring, and
                    coordination of follow-up care. <br />
                    Nurse-led education empowers patients and families to
                    recognize symptoms early and seek timely medical attention.
                    In resource-limited settings, such as many Jordanian
                    hospitals, nurses are often the primary source of
                    post-discharge guidance.

                    Patient education is a cornerstone of PICS management.
                    Educating patients and families about expected symptoms,
                    recovery timelines, self-care strategies, and warning signs
                    improves safety and reduces anxiety. Clear instructions on
                    when to contact healthcare providers enhance early detection
                    of complications and prevent unnecessary hospital
                    readmissions. <br />
                    Educational tools should be culturally appropriate, easy to
                    understand, and tailored to the patient’s literacy level. In
                    Jordan, providing education in Arabic with simple
                    terminology improves accessibility and adherence.

                  <h3 class="info">
                    In Jordanian hospitals, post-ICU care remains fragmented,
                    and formal follow-up clinics are limited. This places
                    greater responsibility on nurses to ensure continuity of
                    care through discharge planning and patient education.
                    Integrating PICS awareness into nursing practice can improve
                    long-term patient outcomes and reduce the burden on
                    healthcare systems. <br />
                    Developing structured educational tools and discharge
                    protocols focused on PICS is particularly relevant in
                    military and public hospitals, where ICU patient volumes are

                    Post-Intensive Care Syndrome is a prevalent and impactful
                    condition affecting ICU survivors worldwide. It encompasses
                    physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments that can
                    persist long after hospital discharge. Early identification,
                    multidisciplinary management, and comprehensive patient
                    education are essential to improving recovery and quality of
                    life. Nurses play a vital role in addressing PICS,
                    particularly in settings with limited post-ICU resources.
                    Increasing awareness and integrating patient-focused
                    education into routine care are critical steps toward better
                    long-term outcomes for ICU survivors.
